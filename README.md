## About the Project
This project deals with DOM manipulation, creating and handling form inputs and updating the User Interface(UI) dynamically without reloads

## Objectives of the Project
- Build a functioning guest list web app

- Use event.preventDefault() to handle form submissions

- Practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript

- Capture and process user input

- Improve my frontend development skills by combining HTML, CSS, and JS


## Features of the Project
- Input field for guest name

- Submit button to add guest

- Guests appear in a list after submission

- "Remove" button for each guest to delete from list

- Guest list is limited to 10 people with alert if exceeded

- "Toggle RSVP" feature to mark guests as “Attending” or “Not Attending”
 
- Added a timestamp for when the guest was added


## How to use the app
- Open the app in your browser.

- Enter a guest name and click “Submit”.

- See the guest appear in the list.

- Use "Toggle RSVP" to change their attendance status.

- Use "Remove" to delete the guest.

- Try editing guest names and view timestamps.

- Enjoy managing your event!

## testing strategy
This project is manually tested in the browser.
I used:

- console.log() for debugging

- Browser DevTools for inspecting elements and events

- Frequent reloads and test inputs to verify behavior
